# Big G Express: Predicting Derates

#### Project Status: Complete

## Motivation
Full derates (a truck going down completely) have a massive impact on a transportation company's business:
* Penalities for late delivery
* Cost and time of the repair
* Unhappy drivers
Overall it is estimated that a full derate costs the company about $4,000. 

## Research questions: 
  1. Can the existence of certain fault codes be used to predict an upcoming 5246 code?
  2. Can the total number of fault codes on a truck be used to predict an upcoming 5246 code?
  3. What diagnostic features best predict an upcoming full derate?
  4. What particular codes are the most prevalent overall?
  5. What particular codes are the most prevalent before a full derate?
  6. How much money can be saved by predicting a full derate?
